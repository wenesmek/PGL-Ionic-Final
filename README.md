## Setting up the back‚öôÔ∏è


Once the backend project is configured, you just have to run ``` node index.js ``` insede the backend root folder.

You'll see some notifications in the terminal about the database creation and advice that says the Back-end is up in the 8080 port.

To realize some test from the _endpoints_ of this api-restfull, you can use the following button(link to postman [workplace](https://web.postman.co/))

## Setting up the Front-End ‚öôÔ∏è

For run the _Ionic_ service you just have to run the following command from the _frontend_ folder:
